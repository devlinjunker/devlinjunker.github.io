  <h1> Devlin's Notebook</h1>

  <div>
  My name is Devlin, I am a Software Engineer living in Portland, Oregon. I enjoy Front-end Development, with most of my experience focused on single page web applications written with JavaScript. I also have experience in Java Web Service development and integration with server side datastores. This page is going to be an living resume and home page for me to store my development ideas and experiences.
