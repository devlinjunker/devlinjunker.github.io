  <h1> Devlin's Notebook</h1>

  <div>
    This page is a living resume and home page for me to store my software development
    ideas and experiences.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My name is Devlin, I am a Software Engineer living in Portland, Oregon. I enjoy
    Front-end Development, with most of my experience focused on single page web
    applications written in JavaScript, but my experiences also include development
    and maintenance of PHP front end applications.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My server side experience is focused on JavaScript integration with REST endpoints,
    as well as limited PHP and Java Web Service development including integration
    with SQL datastores.
